Possible areas for improvement include the Firebase connection, which currently is not fully implemented:
- [ ] When you log out have it delete all previous information (maybe use delete from DOM when signing out? or clear all data? create set to default method)
- [ ] Make login feature work and connect to Firebase
- [ ] Have a message pop up when saving a map to ask for name of map
- [ ] Make Save button able to save waypointLatLng to Firebase

Other possible areas of improvement:
- [ ] Add a print directions button
